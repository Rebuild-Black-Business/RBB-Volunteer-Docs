## Process

Tasks will be added to Trello. Anything in the "Intake" column is fair game. If you see a task that you are willing to tackle, please assign it to yourself, and include a comment tagging the Team Lead / Project Manager. This comment should include a _rough_ estimate of when you anticipate completing the task. As a volunteer organization we want to make sure that tasks do not sit idle for long.

If you need help with a task, or have encountered a task that is more complicated than you expected, please don't hesitate to reach out to any of the points of contact above and we will advise on how to best get that task finished! Overcommunication is key so we can work quickly in these chaotic times.
