## Responsibilities
Front-end Designer responsibilites within the org include the following:

- Development of the Figma document
  - Design System
  - Page layouts
- Any designs should adhere to at a _minimum_ [AA WCAG](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/quickref/?currentsidebar=%23col_customize&levels=aaa) accessibility standards. For designers this is mostly:
  - All text on the page must meet at least AA color contrast standards. [Colorable](https://colorable.jxnblk.com/) is an excellent tool for checking that.
  - Avoid heavy motion. Videos and animations should not auto-play or should only play for a certain amount of time.
- Collaboration with the Front-End Developer team to ensure UI and UX best practices, as well as communicating and collaborating on functional intent of the designs

## Process

Tasks will be added to the public [Trello](https://trello.com/invite/b/epcAqFVo/46b9983a15027c2881a4f09f17d6b162/design) with their MVP / the minimum requirements for that view or component. We gather interest on which designers would like to take a task in coming up with a solution for that view or component and a _rough_ estimate of how long it would take them, assign them the task for work, then set aside a time where those ideas are posted for the wider team to review, discuss, and iterate on if needed. The solution that comes out of that discussion is then committed to done and taken to the development team for review and implementation. As a volunteer organization we want to make sure that tasks do not sit idle for long.

If you need help with Figma, a task, or have encountered a task that is more complicated than you expected, please don't hesitate to reach out to any of the points of contact above and we will advise on how to best get that task finished! Overcommunication is key so we can work quickly in these chaotic times.

## Ideation & Iteration

We need to move quickly to get designs into the hands of developers, so we're going to settle on design system and page layout decisions quickly. That doesn't mean it'll be like that forever - we still want to encourage you to be creative and experiment, but all experimentation should not impact the work we've done in Figma already. Please don't modify the shared Colors, Typography, or Components. If you want to tweak them, just unlink!

We have made an Experiment page for this purpose, but you could also copy to your own personal separate Figma doc while you work. Whenever you're done, bring it to the group.
