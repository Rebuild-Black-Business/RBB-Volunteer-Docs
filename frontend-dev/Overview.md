## Responsibilities
Front-end developer responsibilites within the org include the following:

- Development of web based designs provided by the Front-End Design team
- Collaboration with the Front-End Design team to ensure UI and UX best practices, as well as communicating and collaborating on functional intent of the designs
- Collaboration with the Back-End Dev team to get access to, and display data on the website
- Any development should adhere to at a _minimum_ [AA WCAG](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/quickref/?currentsidebar=%23col_customize&levels=aaa) accessibility standards.
  - Those requirements are long, but the TL;DR version is, all components must be accessible for Assistive Technology (AT) like Screen Readers. Aria roles and labels should be used appropriately
  - All text on the page must meet at least AA color contrast standards. [Colorable](https://colorable.jxnblk.com/) is an excellent tool for checking that.
  - All components should be navigable with a keyboard. Focus states for all interactive elements are required.
  - Any questions about accessibility, reach out to the Front-End Team Lead

## Process

Tasks will be added to the public [Trello](https://trello.com/invite/b/d1sguaj6/866ce39378871b1dcf4966ed687baff9/). Anything in the "Backlog" column is fair game. If you see a task that you are willing to tackle, please assign it to yourself, and include a comment tagging the Team Lead / Project Manager. This comment should include a _rough_ estimate of when you anticipate completing the task. As a volunteer organization we want to make sure that tasks do not sit idle for long.

If you need help with a task, or have encountered a task that is more complicated than you expected, please don't hesitate to reach out to any of the points of contact above and we will advise on how to best get that task finished! Overcommunication is key so we can work quickly in these chaotic times.
